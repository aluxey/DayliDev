# Daily Code Challenges

Welcome to my **Daily Code Challenges** repository! ðŸŽ¯ Here, I commit to solving coding challenges every day using **PHP** and **JavaScript**.
This repository serves as a journal of my learning journey and showcases my dedication to improving my coding skills consistently.

## About the Repository

This repository contains:

- **Daily Challenges:** Solutions to coding challenges solved daily in PHP and JavaScript.
- **Problem Descriptions:** Each solution is accompanied by a brief description of the problem being solved.
- **Code Structure:**
  - Inside each folder, you will find:
    - The problem description in `README.md`.
    - The solution files (`solution.php`, `solution.js`, etc.).

## Goals

- **Consistency:** Commit at least one challenge every day.
- **Learning:** Explore various problem domains such as algorithms, data structures, and real-world scenarios.
- **Growth:** Continuously improve problem-solving skills and understanding of PHP and JavaScript.
